# PHP-OOP-Login-Registration
This is a basic object-oriented login and registration system I created in PHP as a learning excercise/for school. This is a barebones design and obviously isn't really suitable for any real world application. I don't know yet if I plan to expand on the code.


I hope this can be a help to others looking to learn a simple web login/registration. I plan to write a step-by-step process in the future. While I hope others can learn from this, I'm always still learning myself and would love tips, tricks, feedback anytime anyone is willing to share.
